00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,610
我们有一手好牌
We got a hand of aces.


00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,770
他肯定愿意来点高级的
I think he'd appreciate an upgrade.

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,470
没问题
I will.

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,490
我得走了
I should get going.

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,070
我猜你觉得你的新生活可能不会长久
So I guess you weren't sure your new life was gonna work out.

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
我从没有忘记你
I never stopped thinking about you.

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,830
这些都不重要了
Doesn't matter now.

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,930
怎么样
Well,

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,610
我看起来怎么样
how do I look?

428
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,780
像个陌生人
Like somebody else.

435

所以你并不确定
So you don't know for certain

440
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
没道理啊  我是说  也许索尔变了
It doesn't make sense. I mean, maybe Saul changed.

441
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,410
也许我把他惹毛了  但是索尔不傻
Maybe I pissed him off. But Saul's smart.
