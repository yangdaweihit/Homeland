想要毁灭我们的敌人们

所以我才想不明白
I-I can't figure it out.

110
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
你肯定干了什么勾当

不知道这是怎么回事
I have no idea where this is coming from.

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,490
你得信
Believe it.

127
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,650

你的撤退方案  可以启动了  
Your fallback plan-- time to execute it.

132
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,980
我没撤退方案怎么办
What if I don't have one?

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,640
可能是真的呢
Could be true.

134
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,390
别废话了  卡莉  你得赶紧消失掉

照片也就能拖延一下
This picture buys you time.

136
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,550
保持低调  他们才不会追杀你
As long as you keep your head down, they won't come after you.

137
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,090
你和索尔的这个行动  怎么进行
So, your operation with Saul- how does it work?

138
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,250
不重要
Doesn't matter.

139
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,760
告诉我
Tell me.

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,070
索尔提供名字  我杀人后拍照
Saul provides a name, I provide proof of death,

141
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,880
交回邮箱  再拿新名单
Return to the drop, get another name.

142
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,990
那你最后一次去邮箱是我的名字
And the last time you went to the drop, you got my name?

143
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,810
和你说过了
Told you that already.

144
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,790
为什么
Why?

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
不知道  也不想知道
I don't know. I don't want to know.

146
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,970
可我什么也没做
But I didn't do anything!

147
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,620
听着卡莉  你的名字的确在邮箱里
Listen to me, Carrie. Your name was in the box, okay'?

148
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,710
可能因为你还不知道的事情
Probably for something you're not even aware of.

149
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,640
我知道这不好接受
Now, I know that's hard to hear.

150
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,530
我得找索尔谈谈
I have to talk to Saul.

151
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,760
但你得知道  他圣命难违
For all you know, he was given a direct order.

152
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,220
什么意思
What's your point?

153
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,500
可能有某个高层要你死
Somebody, somewhere, likely very senior, wants you dead.

154
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,920
要是他们知道你还没死
If they think you're not dead,

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,890
还会派别人来搞你的
they're gonna send somebody to finish the job.

156
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,020
你得消失掉
You got to disappear.

157
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,140
你向我保证说你们不打算推翻
You assured me that there was no plot

158
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,840
巴沙尔・阿尔阿萨德政权
to overthrow Bashar Al-Assad.

159
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,180
-确实没有  -索尔
- There isn't. - Saul.

160
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,330
很荣幸你能光临我的逾越节宴会
You honor me with your presence

161
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,250
所以我也会与你默契
at my seder table, so, I'll play along.

162
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,560
如果你有取代阿萨德的计划
If you had a plan to replace Assad,

163
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,760
我们都明白会是约瑟夫将军
we understand that it would be with general Youssef.

164
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,480
约瑟夫是个好人选
Youssef would be a good choice.

165
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,600
如果我们计划是那样的话
If we had a plan like that.

166
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,670
他是阿拉维派的  阿萨德的连襟
He's alawite, Assad's cousin by marriage.

167
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,370
他在军方有些势力
He's popular with the military.

168
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,680
可有人说
Well, some say he was behind

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,940
他是阿萨尔镇化武袭击的幕后指使
the chemical weapons attack in Khan Al-Asal.

170
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,880
那些消息都没有证实
Those allegations have never been confirmed.

171
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,250
那我们换个玩法吧
Let's play another game.

172
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,230
还有其他选择吗
What's the alternative?

173
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,350
还留着阿萨德吗
Leave Assad in place?

174
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,680
阿拉伯人相互残杀时
When Arabs are killing Arabs,

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,930
至少他们不会向以色列发起攻击
at least they're not firing rockets at Israel.

176
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,970
对于中东的和平
That's hardly a long-term strategy

177
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,900
这不是长久之计
for peace in the middle east.

178
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,620
你还真以为那帮混蛋希冀和平吗
You really think any of those murderers want peace?

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
过去你是以色列的朋友
You used to be a good friend to Israel.

180
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,520
现在也是
I'm still a good friend.

181
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,060
你以前做得更好
You used to be a better one.

182
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,520
因泰
Etai?

183
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
今晚过得真愉快
I've enjoyed this evening so much.

184
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,720
很高兴你能光临这里
Well, I'm glad you could share it with us.

185
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,910
吃甜点吧
So, dessert. Mm.

186
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,200
我们要在一刻钟内离开
We need to leave in 15 minutes.

187
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,680
没事吧
Is everything all right?

188
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,360
当然
It will be.

189
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,310
你好  这里是卡莉・麦吉森
Hi. This is Carrie Mathison.

190
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,010
请留言静候回电
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

191
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,730
你回来了
You're back.

192
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,630
嗯  紧赶慢赶的
Ah, catching up.

193
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,920
卡莉呢
And Carrie?

194
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,300
还在琢磨谁搞的那次袭击呢
Still trying to figure out who was responsible for the attack.

195
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,820
我是想帮她  不过...
I was helping her, but...

196
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,090
我还是在这里更有用
we decided I was needed here.

197
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,370
奥托真该开掉她
Otto should fire her ass.

198
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,250
-她救了奥托的命  -她没做好本职工作
She saved his life. She didn't do her job.

199
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,860
她的工作就是保证老板的安全
Which was to make sure he was safe in the first place.

200
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,340
她建议过不要去
She advised him not to go.

201
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,510
你有事吗
Do you need something?

202
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,960
给我文档的线人把我耍了
My source for the documents screwed me.

203
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,210
他给我的优盘是空的
He gave me an empty flash drive.

204
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,100
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - I don't know why.

205
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,900
他可能害怕了
Maybe he's afraid.

206
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,270
中情局还在跟着我
The CIA is still following me.

207
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,550
好吧  要我做什么
Okay, what can I do?

208
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,030
你之前代理过的那个黑客  萨宾什么的
You had a client, that hacker, Sabine something.

209
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,230
她不会帮你  而作为她的律师  我也反对
She won't help you, and as her lawyer, I'd advise her not to.

210
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,370
乔纳斯  她很出名
Jonas, she's famous.

211
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,210
如果她出面  我的线人会回信的
If she reaches out to my guy, he'll respond.

212
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,870
她已经被软禁了三年
She's under house arrest for three years.

213
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,530
政府一直在盯着她
The government really went after her.

214
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,980
别去烦她了
Give her a break, hum.

215
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
-烦她  -对
- A break? - Yeah.

216
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,820
政府一直盯着我们所有人
The government's after all of us!

217
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,060
有什么事吗
Everything all right?

218
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,060
还好
Fine.

219
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,300
我在让乔纳斯帮忙找我的线人
I'm asking Jonas to help me track down my source

220
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,560
这样我们就可以得到余下的文件了
so we can get a look at the rest of those documents.

221
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,230
当然  帮她办了吧  挺重要的
Of course, help her. It's important.

222
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,260
有什么问题吗
What's the problem?

223
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,600
没有  我会去办的
No problem. I'll make the call.

224
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,300
越快越好
Sooner the better.

225
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,210
喂
Hello?

226
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,740
有消息吗
Anything?

227
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,060
没有  我回小屋找她
No. I drove up to the cottage.

228
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,210
她已经走了  所有东西消失  没留下线索
She wasn't there. Everything gone, no trace.

229
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,250
我们应该报警
We should call the police.

230
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,200
当然应该  但我们不能
Of course we should, but we can't.

231
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,030
她说那样她会更危险
She said it would put her in more danger.

232
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,620
她得靠自己来搞清楚真相
She has to figure it out on her own to get to the truth.

233
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,600
谁会这样过日子呢
I mean, who lives like this?

234
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,570
她会
She does.

235
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,320
我知道你很担心
I know you're worried.

236
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,980
我也是
So am I.

237
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,170
准备好了吗
Ready?

238
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,500
弗兰妮
Franny.

239
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,800
你的名字是根据你爷爷的名字起的
You're named after your grandfather,

240
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,200
弗兰克・麦吉森
Frank Mathison.

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
你知道吗
Did you know that?

242
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,800
我们好久没有见面了
We haven't seen each other for a while.

243
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,170
我不得不离开你
I had to leave you,

244
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,660
而你一定很生气
and you're probably really angry about that.

245
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,870
我不怪你
And I don't blame you.

246
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,640
不过  亲爱的  出了点事
But, honey, something happened,

247
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,300
我跟你在一起不安全
And it wasn't safe for me to be with you.

248
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,760
但我会尽我的一切...
But I am doing everything that I can to get...

249
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

250
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,970
如果你尽一切努力回到她身边
If you're doing everything you can to get back to her,

251
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,410
说明你还活着
then you're still alive.

252
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,990
-那又怎样  -如果这录像到了仇家手里 
- So? - So, if this falls into the Wrong hands,

253
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,300
你就彻底废了
you're fucked.

254
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,820
我不会一直躲着的
I'm not going away forever.

255
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,400
只要等到事情解决就好了
Just until this situation is resolved.

256
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,140
这事怎么解决
How is it getting resolved?

257
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,350
我会搞清楚谁要杀我...
I'm gonna figure out who targeted rne...

258
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,180
-然后他们会一直找你  -我会搞定的
then they'll keep come looking for you. - And I will fix it!

259
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,800
如果他们认为你还活着
And if they think you're still alive,

260
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,940
他们就会通过弗兰妮找到你
they will get to you through Franny.

261
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,090
-但是  -卡莉
- But... - Carrie!

262
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,090
为了弗兰妮的安全  你必须装死
If you want Franny to be safe, you have to be dead.

263
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,110
天呐
Jesus.

264
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,420
你被迫离开自己的骨肉时是何感觉
How did you feel when you had to leave your kid?

265
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,980
不是所有人都适合为人父母
Not everyone's fit to be a parent.

266
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,660
继续录吧
Let's do this.

267
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,130
弗兰妮
Franny.

268
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,010
也许现在...
Maybe now...

269
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,780
你是"弗兰斯西"了
You're using "Frances."

270
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,760
我们已经好久没有见面了
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

271
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,270
我不得不离开你  而...
I had to leave you, and...

272
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,490
你一定在记恨我
You probably hate me for it.

273
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,780
我不怪你
And I don't blame you.

274
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,350
但是出了点事情...
But something happened, and...

275
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,140
我和你在一起会很危险
It wasn't safe for me to be with you.

276
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,000
我会尽...
I'm doing ev...

277
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,410
妈的
Shit.

278
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,270
我尽了一切努力
I did everything that I could

279
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,560
回到你身边
to get back to you.

280
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,740
但我没能成功
But I-I didn't make it.

281
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,700
我从事的那种工作...
The kind of work that I did...

282
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,030
非常危险
It's dangerous.

283
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,410
我忠于职守  愿意为它冒险
But I believed in it, so I was willing to take that risk.

284
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,380
但是...
But...

285
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
但是后来有了你
But then you came along.

286
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,690
我意识到我想改变自己的生活
And I realized that I wanted something different.

287
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,250
我想要  更好的生活
I wanted... a better life.

288
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,470
我和你度过了一段幸福的生活
And I had it with you for a while.

289
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,240
但是...
But...

290
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,380
我没有抛弃你
I didn't abandon you.

291
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,100
我知道被抛弃是什么感受
I know what that feels like,

292
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,800
我绝对不会抛弃你
and I would never do that to you.

293
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,700
你...
You...

294
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,960
你是最重要的
Are the most important, the...

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
我一生中最美好的事
The best thing

296
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,590
就是生了你
that I have ever done.

297
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,790
我人生中所有过错得以弥补
You make up for every mistake

298
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,370
只因有你
that I've ever made.

299
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,770
尽管你可能不相信...
And although you probably don't believe it...

300
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,620
我爱你...
I love you...

Very, very much.

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,950
干什么
Was?

303
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,620
我找萨宾
I'm looking for Sabine.

304
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,330
这里没人叫萨宾
There's no Sabine here.

305
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,050
我和她约了见面
I have a meeting with her.

306
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,740
中间人是她的律师  乔纳斯・赫兰德
It was arranged through her lawyer, Jonas Hollander.

307
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,760
是吗
Is that so?

308
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,030
没见到萨宾之前我是不会走的
I'm not leaving until I see Sabine.

309
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,290
萨宾被软禁了
Sabine's under house arrest.

310
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,690
而德国联情局一直阴魂不散
But the BND keeps sniffing around,

311
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,360
想找出对她不利的证据
Trying to find something to use against her.

312
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,480
把她送进监狱
To send her to prison.

313
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,340
手机放进去  这袋子能屏蔽信号
Put your phone in here. It blocks the signal.

314
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,290
我已经把电话卡拿出来了
I already took out the SIM card.

315
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,230
要么把手机丢进袋子  要么滚出去
Put your phone in the bag or get out.

316
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,070
她来找萨宾
She's looking for Sabine.

317
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,750
你是萨宾吗
Are you Sabine?

318
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,640
怎么了
What's going on?

319
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,060
我才是萨宾
I'm Sabine.

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,060
你刚刚那么做是什么意思
What was that about?

321
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,740
我不得不谨慎点  抱歉
I have to be careful. Sorry.

322
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,440
我们知道你的丰功伟绩  太漂亮了
We know your work. Amazing.

323
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,880
萨宾不能和记者交谈
Sabine's not allowed to communicate with journalists.

324
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,880
这是她的软禁条件
It's a condition of her house arrest.

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,300
她是我们这边的
She's one of us.

326
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,430
她揭发了美国中情局和德国联情局
She exposed the CIA and the BND.

327
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,490
你搞得他们焦头烂额
You kicked their asses.

328
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,210
还能再火上浇油一把
There's more where that came from.

329
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,990
什么意思
What do you mean?

330
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,930
更多的文件
More documents.

331
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,060
-真的假的  -问题是
- No shit. - The problem is,

332
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,550
我联系不到那个"把文件黑出来的人"
"the guy who hacked the documents" I can't find him.

333
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,780
加布・H・库德
Gabe H. Coud.

334
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,270
-谁  -加布・H・库德  这是他的网名
- Who? - Gabe H. Coud. What he calls himself online.

335
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,380
-就是"傻逼"倒过来写  -你认识他
- It's "Douche bag" backwards. - You know him?

336
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,940
如雷贯耳  他很出名
Of him. He's famous.

337
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,240
他可是黑了美国中情局的人
Dude hacked the CIA.

338
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,400
你能帮我找到他吗
You can help me find him?

339
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,340
没有我找不到的人
I can find anyone.

340
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,190
你如果去找加布・H・库德
If you start looking for Gabe H. Coud,

341
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,730
就会招来不必要的注意
you'll attract the attention from the wrong people.

342
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,180
这简直是回到了前东德时代
This is like something from the Stasi days.

343
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,570
你们连个消息都不敢打听了吗
You guys are afraid to ask for information?

344
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,500
德国联情局巴不得把我丢进监狱
The BND would love to throw my ass into prison.

345
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,410
让他们试试看
Let them try.

346
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,990
我会让他们生不如死
I'll make their lives a living hell.

347
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,310
承担风险的是萨宾  又不是你
Sabine will be taking the risk, not you.

348
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,720
我也面临着被逮捕的风险  还有引渡
I'm facing arrest, too. And extradition.

349
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,870
我是疑犯  知道这意味着什么吗
I'm a person of interest. Do you know what that means?

350
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,890
意味着你不害怕
It means you're not scared.

351
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,360
意味着我在努力不害怕
It means I try not to be.

how do I look?

428

像个陌生人

你亲眼见到索尔用信箱吗
Did you ever see Saul use the drop?

430
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,150
-卡莉  别这样  -我必须要知道

没有  没有授权联络
I'm deniable. No contact authorized.

434

我们得走了
We have to move.

435
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,830
所以你并不确定
So you don't know for certain

436
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,420
-是不是索尔把我的名字放进去的  -天呐
- it was Saul who put my name in the box? - Christ.

437
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,790
你到底确定不确定
Do you or don't you?

438
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,350
这是索尔的行动
It's Saul's operation.

439
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,540
我只需要知道这么多
That's all I need to know.

440
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
没道理啊  我是说  也许索尔变了
It doesn't make sense. I mean, maybe Saul changed.

441
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,410
也许我把他惹毛了  但是索尔不傻
Maybe I pissed him off. But Saul's smart.

442
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,350
让你来杀我太傻了
Sending you to kill me is not smart.

443
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,440
太他娘蠢了
It's fucking stupid.

444
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,190
我活生生地站在这里就是最好的证据
The fact that I'm still alive proves it.

445
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,420
不论你怎么想  你都是个目标
You're still a target either way you look at it.

446
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,990
奎恩  如果不是索尔把我名字放进去的
Quinn, if Saul didn't put my name in the box,

447
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,740
你们的行动里就有内鬼
Then someone's inside your operation.

448
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,020
这之后你拿到的名字  都不靠谱
Any name you get after this, it's not legitimate.

449
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,550
我们试试看
Let's test it.

450
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,830
-带我去你的信箱  -不  我自己来
- Take me to your drop. - No, I'll handle it.

451
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,250
-我跟你一起去  -赶紧上车
- I'll go with you. - Get in the car.

452
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,610
带你去火车站
We're taking you to the train.

453
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,070
-不  -卡莉
- No. - Carrie.

454
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,230
你是说我在这世上
You are telling me that someone I trust more

455
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,840
最信任的人要杀了我
than I've ever trusted anyone is trying to kill me.

456
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
然后我还得乖乖面对  不能提出质疑
And I'm just supposed to accept that, no questions asked?

457
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,450
余生在逃亡中度过  再也不能见我女儿
Spend my life on the run, give up my daughter?

458
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,960
奎恩  我必须得搞清楚
Quinn, I have to know.

459
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,450
这边走  将军
Right this way, General.

460
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,510
请进
Come in.

461
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,960
这里有些表格需要您签字
There are some forms you need to sign.

462
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,960
不应该有表格
There shouldn't be any forms.

463
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,820
请坐
Please sit.

464
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,600
这是怎么回事
What is happening here?

465
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,290
我是中情局的人
I'm CIA.

466
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,680
这家医院的人都是中情局的人
Everyone in this facility is CIA.

467
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,840
当然  除了手术团队以外
Except for the surgical team, of course.

468
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,760
你来到日内瓦
You've traveled to Geneva in violation

469
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,410
违反了国际制裁条例
of international sanctions.

470
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,900
你在这里没有基本权利  没有豁免权
You have no rights here, no immunity.

471
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,250
我们可以逮捕你  以战争罪将你送到海牙
We can arrest you and have you transported to the Hague

472
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,040
接受庭审
to stand trial for war crimes.

473
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,700
你怎么能这样
How dare you?

474
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,240
继续盯着表格看吧
Keep looking at the form.

475
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,740
还有个办法
There is an alternative.

476
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,570
可惜  我们现在没时间讨论了
Unfortunately, we don't have time to discuss it now.

477
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,460
等到中午开饭
Wait until lunch is served.

478
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,730
如果你想抽根烟
Say you want a smoke.

479
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,760
就去花园里独自散个步
Go for a walk in the garden. Go alone.

480
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,750
在这里签字
Now sign the form.

481
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,660
谢谢  将军
Thank you, General.

482
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,630
你现在应该想回到妻子身边吧
You'll probably want to get back to your wife now.

483
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,780

找到他了  我们接上头了
Found him. We're on.

493
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,250
问他为什么给了我张空盘
Ask him why he gave me that bullshit empty drive.

494
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,160
他说他把那些文件给你了
He says he gave you the documents.

495
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,420
硬盘是空的
The drive was empty.

496
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,860
空的吗
Empty?

497
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,890
科赞尼克这个傻逼
Fucking Korzenik.

498
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,330
他说肯定是被他朋友动手脚了
He says that his friend must've screwed with the drive.

499
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,420

Friend?

500
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,110
到底有多少人知道这件事
How many people know about this?

501
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,150
科赞尼克
Korzenik.

502
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,610
你个混蛋
You asshole.

503

回电话
Call me back.

505
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,910

我要找你的白痴男友

放松  我们会发财的

你卖掉了吗

520
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,450
你想把它们送人
You were going to give them away.

521
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,140
以自由的名义
In the name of freedom.

522

你知道什么才能让你自由吗

金钱
Money.

他们派了辆车来

尽管你没资格拿

-当然  -你确定

信任别人是我人生中的一个理想
One of my ambitions in life is to be a trusting person.

I think it's an admirable quality, you know, trust.

564
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,640
那些与之相反的人  那些...
People who are the opposite, who are...

565
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,020
用英语怎么说来着
what's the word in English I mean?

566
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,070
-多疑  -疑神疑鬼
- Suspicious? - Cynical.

567
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,350
那样的人生可不会惬意
That's not a pleasant life.

568
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,410
所以你看  我想信任你科赞尼克先生
So, you see, I want to trust you, Mr. Korzenik.

569
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,990
不幸的是  我疑神疑鬼
Unfortunately, I am cynical.

570
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,450
真平静
So peaceful.

571
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,690

Don't you think?

572
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,270
我去抽支烟

573

575
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,440
怎么  你不相信我是去抽烟
What, you don't trust me to have a smoke?

576
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,040
你觉得我要做什么
What do you think I'll do?

577
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,610
在我女儿手术的时候游到湖那边去
Swim across the lake while my daughter is in surgery?

578
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,200
午餐愉快
Enjoy your lunch.

579
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,480
约瑟夫将军
General Youssef.

580
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,710
索尔・贝伦森  我受宠若惊
Saul Berenson. I'm flattered.

581
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,120
请坐
Please, have a seat.

582
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,420
我们时间不多
We don't have much time.

583
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,450
要来一支吗
Care for one?

584
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,230
将军  你我都清楚叙利亚的危机
General, you and I both know the crisis in Syria

585
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,770
在日益恶化
is getting worse every day.

586
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,510
你指望我相信你关心我的国家
You wish me to believe you are concerned for my country?

587
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,940
我们的分歧在于你们的总统
Our argument is with your president,

588
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,930
不是叙利亚的人民
not with the Syrian people.

589
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,870
极端组织正在准备
The Islamic state is preparing

590
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,910
对政府进行一次大规模进攻
a major offensive against the regime.

591
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,350
所以
So?

592
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,800
他们占领着叙利亚的一半领土
They control half of all Syrian territory.

593
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,570
战斗减员和逃兵
Your regular army's been reduced

594
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,240
让政府军数量不断减少
through casualties and desertions.

595
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,590
说点我不知道的
Tell me something I don't know.

596
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,140
坦白来说  将军
Let's talk frankly, General.

597
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,330
你打不赢的
You will lose the war.

598
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,190
等到大马士革沦陷
When Damascus falls,

599
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,010
这个国家所有的阿拉维派
every Alawi in the country,

600
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,240
包括你和你的家人  都会被屠杀 
including you and your family, will be slaughtered.

601
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,340
我知道你热爱你的国家
I know you love your country.

602
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,320
你一点都不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

603
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,530
我知道你是个有才干的指挥官
I know you're an able commander.

604
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,960
高级官员们对你十分忠诚
You have a loyal following among the high-ranking officers.

605
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,850
我们相信他们会支持由你来领导国家
We believe they will support you to lead your country.

606
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,470
领导我的...
To lead my...

607
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,840
等你取代了阿萨德
When you replace Assad.

608
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,390
这是你对叙利亚问题的解决方法
This is your solution for Syria?

609
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,780
这是当前最好的方法
It's the best one on the table.

610
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,550
一半的政府机构部长是巴沙尔的亲属
Half of the government ministers are Bashir's family.

611
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,470
全部非常忠诚  我要怎么解决他们
All loyal. How do I deal with them?

612
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,960
现在  我们正往你飞机上搬一千万美元
At this moment, we're loading $10 million onto your jet.

613
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,220
那些钱会给你买来很大的影响力
That money will buy you a great deal of influence.

614
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,070
巴沙尔也有钱行贿
Bashir has money to bribe, too.

615
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,920
但是你  以叙利亚新任总统的身份
But you, as Syria's new president--

616
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,560
许诺自由选举  民主改革
promising free elections, democratic reforms--

617
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,440
你会得到美国的支持
You'll have the support of the United States.

618
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,090
这支持包括军队和武器吗
This support, it includes troops and weapons?

619
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,380
我们会竭尽所能
We will do what it takes

620
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,840
让你们的政府统一全国
to unite the country around your government.

621
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,650
但是我们必须快点行动
But we must act quickly.

622
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,740
在你的敌人变得更强大之前
Before your enemies gain more strength.

623
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,840
你错了
You are wrong.

624
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,230
世界明白叙利亚真正的威胁
The world recognizes the real danger in Syria,

625
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,390
是所谓的伊斯兰国
the so-called Islarnic state.

626
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,190
他们一旦变强
As they get stronger,

627
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,300
巴沙尔就看起来没那么可恶了
Bashir no longer looks so evil.

628
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,450
世界就会改变态度
The world will come around.

629
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,890
他们会支持我们抵抗伊斯兰国
They will support us against Daesh.

630
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,180
如果阿萨德继续掌权
If Assad stays in power,

631
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,400
他就得为自己的罪行负责
he'll have to answer for his crimes.

632
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,800
什么罪行
What crimes?

633
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,790
铁桶炸弹  化学武器
Barrel bombs. Chemical weapons.

634
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,980
胡说八道
Bullshit. Lies.

635
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,650
我们看到古塔区的尸体了
We've seen the bodies in Ghouta.

636
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,400
阿萨德已经向世界承认是他的指挥官
Assad's already told the world it was his commanders

637
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,700
使用了武器
who fired the weapons.

638
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,760
他会毫不犹豫的送你上国际战犯法庭
Think he'll hesitate to hand you over to the ICC?

639
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,500
他不会指责我的
He will not accuse me.

640
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,950
我个人对这些事没有任何责任
I am not personally responsible for any of that.

641
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,490
我相信你 
Well, I believe you.

642
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,520
我也相信阿萨德已经向世人展示
I also believe Assad has demonstrated

643
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,260
他为了保住自己的权力
he will do anything, he will say anything

644
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,150
会不择手段
to keep his grip on power.

645
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,290
将军  我们快没时间了
General, we're out of time.

646
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,770
我知道你是爱国者
I know you're a patriot.

647
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,490
你的人民已经受尽苦难
Your people have suffered so much already.

648
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,270
给他们一个前进方向吧
Show them the way forward.

649
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,640
带领他们走向光明
Lead 'em into the light.

650
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,910
他们找到了
They found it?

651
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,120
合作愉快
Yes. We're good.

652
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,480
谢谢
Thank you.

653
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,580
只有那一个备份  我发誓
There is just that one copy. I swear.

654
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,880
我留一份是为了...
I only kept it...

655
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
科赞尼
Korzy?

656
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,790
科赞尼
Korzy?

657
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,690
我进去  把东西放下
I go in, I drop it off,

658
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,320
就会得到名单上的下一个名字
I get the next name on the list.

659
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,060
那我们就等着有人来拿吗
Then we wait for someone to pick it up?

660
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,940
我们等索尔来拿
We wait for Saul to pick it up.

661
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,840
他一出现  我们就走
And when he shows up, we leave.

662
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,360
你逃得越远越好
And you get as far away from here as possible.

663
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,160
同意吗
Agreed?

664
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,000
同意
Agreed.

665
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,030
坐过去  我们可能要火速离开
Slide over. We may have to move fast.

666
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,550
{\an8}你的朋友到了

667
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,370
我应该送你去医院
I should take you to a hospital.

668
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,170
不用  我没事
No, I'm okay.

669
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,390
你情况不妙
You are not okay.

670
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,030
我们得停车
We should pull over.

671
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,850
不  回去抓他
No. Be coming back to get him.

672
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,530
那人是谁
Who was that?

673
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,580
想杀你的人也想杀我
Whoever wants you dead wants me dead.

674
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,470
-你得去火车站  -不
- We have to get you to the train station. - No.

675
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,090
你的照片在信箱里
Your photo's in the drop.

676
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,280
你还没有暴露  你可以离开
You'll have your cover. You can go.

677
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,680
我不会扔下你
I am not leaving you.

678
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,590
我不走
I'm not.

679
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,640
看看后边
Check the back.

680
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,030
有个弹洞
There's an exit wound.

681
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,320
很好  是贯穿伤
Good. It went through.

682
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,620
不会打中动脉
Could've hit an artery.

683
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,020
否则我早流血流死了
I'd have bled out by now.

684
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,930
得给你打点吗啡
We need to get some morphine into you.

685
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,570
-架子上有个急救箱  -好的
- There's a medical kit on the bench. - Okay.

686
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,550
奎恩  还醒着吗
Quinn, you with me?

687
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,290
好了
All right.

688
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,420
转过去
Turn over.

689
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,080
好了  我要给你扎针了
All right, I'm gonna muscle it.

690
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,390
得使劲按住这些伤口
We need to put some pressure on these wounds.

691
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,150
好了  挺住  坐起来

692
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,260
挺住  奎恩
Hang on, Quinn.

693
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,120
我的同僚让我把这个交给你
My colleague asked me to give you these.

694
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,020
我有个请求
I have a request.

695
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,930
什么请求
What is it?

696
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,360
我希望我的妻子和女儿留下来
I'd like my wife and daughter to remain behind.

697
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,470
在欧洲生活  直到我们国家的冲突解决
To live in Europe until the conflict in my country is resolved.

698
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,360
我敬重您对家庭的牵挂
I admire your concern for your family.

699
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,180
但我不能允许
But I can't allow it.

700
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,760
你独自回到叙利亚会引起警觉
Returning to Syria without them would raise a red flag.

701
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,040
你们怎么知道我会干这事
How do you know I'll do this?

702
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,460
我收了你们的钱
I have your money.

703
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,050
我回到家  可以什么都不干
When I get home, I could just do nothing.

704
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,750
是的  你可以
Yes. You could.

705
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,500
但是我们赌你会更聪明
But we're betting you're smarter than that.

706
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,340
他问自己家人是否能留下来
He asked if his family could stay behind.

707
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,810
这是个好兆头
That's a good sign.

708
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,000
是吗
Yeah?

709
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,480
是啊
Yeah.

710
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,310
说明他知道自己被玩残了
It means he knows he's fucked.

711
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,860
说明他也许会乖乖合作
It means he might just cooperate.

712
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,840
通讯录里只有一个号码
There's only one number in the memory.

713
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,590
打过去
Call it.

714
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,080
我的天呐
Oh, my god.
